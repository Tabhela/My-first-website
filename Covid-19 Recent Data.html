    <h3>International Data</h3>

    <p>According to the World Health Organisation, as of April 26, 2022, the global numbers for the Corona Virus pandemic are still a cause for concern. More tha 500 000 000 cases have been recorded so far. While this is alarming, considering the number of cases that go unreported, especially in developing countries, the actual number will be much higher than this </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3> Is the pandemic over?</h3>

  <p>According to the renowned Dr Fauci of the United States of Africa, we are now out of the pandemic stage. This should not be misconstrued to mean we can now throw caution aside and be reckless. It only means things are better, we can relax a little but we can still make things better by still being responsible and observing Covid protocols. As you can see from the numbers, this is far from over</p>

      <h3>National Data</h3>
      <p>Nationally, the situation is worse than the global trajectory, as shown in Figure 2 below. To put this into perspective, while 60% of the population globally has been vaccinated, only 31% people in South Africa have been vaccinated. This is due to a combination of factors ranging from reluctance to be vaccinated from the population as well as poor access to resources from other regions of the county. The South African Government is working on a plan to embark on an outreach to educate people on the benefits of the vaccines as well as provide vaccines to people in remote areas.
        <br>
        <h3>Local Data</h3>
        <p>The Western Cape accounts for just over 20 % of the total infections in South Africa. The Western Cape government aims to participate in the National Government Initiative to educate the population and provide vaccines. Take a look at the latest Covid data in the table below.
